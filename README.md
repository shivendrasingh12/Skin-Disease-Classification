# Skin-Disease-Classification
A patient can recover from skin diseases if it is detected and treated in the early stages and this can achieve cure ratios of over 95%. Hence, it is important to identify these diseases at their initial stage to control them from spreading. Skin diseases are primarily diagnosed visually, beginning with an initial clinical screening and followed potentially by dermoscopic analysis. Such a system is often prone to errors.
